#!/bin/sh
# grade.sh is a shell script that runs the given main class
# on all of the inputs (*.in files) in the given input directory.
# Does all this by copying the src/*.java files into TestingTemp/
# and running the tests in TestingTemp/.
#
# usage examples:
#   ./grade.sh JavaHelloWorld PublicTestCases
#   ./grade.sh PA1Main MyTestCases
#
# FIXME: This is not available yet.
# It is also possible to run the script on an individual file:
#   ./grade.sh JavaHelloWorld PublicTestCases file1.in
#
# The assumption is that each main is operating on a given file.
# The input files in the specified input directory will be 
# given to the program.  Here are the operations performed:
#
#   javac JavaHelloWorld.java
#   java JavaHelloWorld PublicTestCases/file1.in
#   java JavaHelloWorld PublicTestCases/file2.in
#	...
#
# Another assumption is that all of the source files are in the 
# default package and are in the src/ subdirectory.
